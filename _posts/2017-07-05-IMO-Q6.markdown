One of my favourite math olympiad question.

<strong>The IMO 1988 Q.6.</strong>

<div class="question">
Q.6 Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that $ab + 1$ divides $a^2 + b^2$. Show that $\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}$ is the square of an integer.
</div>
<div class="answer" >
To answer this we first try out finding a pattern. Number theory is easier when patterns are found.  So let's go forward and make some rough assumptions.

Let 
<center>$$f(a,b) = \frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1} $$</center>
Now let's keep substituting random integers for $a$ and $b$. I tried with small numbers and got these,
<center>
$$f(0,0) = 0 = 0^2 $$
$$f(1,0) = 1 = 1^2 $$ 
$$f(0,1) = 1 = 1^2 $$
$$f(2,0) = 2 = 2^2 $$
</center>
