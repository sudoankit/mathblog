Welcome to $\Sigma^2$, a collection of mathematical problems, book recommendations and documentries. <!-- Awesome! Nice to check the source code. Dig deeper and you might find out something nice in here! --> 

The symbol '&#x2605;' means highly recommended but you already knew this. 

The symbol '<font color="gold">&#x2605;</font>' means <u>legendary</u> which you didn't know.
