Hi, I'm $\Lambda$n$\kappa$it Panda.

My interests include algrebraic topology $\cup$ differential topology $\cup$ number theory $\cup$ Reimann geometry $\cup$ partial differential equations in pure mathematics. 

I also do applied mathematics in areas of computational fluid dynamics $\cup$ astronomy $\cup$ physics $\cup$ biology. 

This blog is about all mathematics I do and some get interesting which I post here. ( you can go back to my homepage by clicking home above, a guidance arrow has been drawn for your convenience. )

In case you're wondering what the title means, it's on Cardinality of the Continuum. This states that the cardinality of the real numbers is equal to the cardinality of all subsets of natural numbers.

The picture is of the Calabi-Yau manifold with $n = 5$. 

The Calabi-Yau manifold which is visualized is a 2D slice through a 6-dimensional manifold in a projective space expressed as the 4D manifold $z^5_1 + z^5_2 = 1.$ We can calculate $z_1$ and $z_2$ from: 

$$z_1(\theta, \xi, \kappa_1) = e^{ \frac{2\pi i k_1}{n}} \cosh(\theta + \xi i)^{\frac{2}{n}}    $$

$$i \cdot z_2(\theta, \xi, \kappa_2) = e^{ \frac{2\pi i k_2}{n}} \sinh(\theta + \xi i)^{\frac{2}{n}}    $$

`MATLAB` was used to draw the figure using the following imformation from Hanson's [paper](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~hansona/papers/CP2-94.pdf).
