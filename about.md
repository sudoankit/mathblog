Hi, I'm [Ankit Panda](https://sudoankit.github.io/resume/) from India and [@sudoankit](http://sudoankit.github.io) from the internet.

Computer science undergraduate interested in <b>computer vision and graphics, mathematics, computational and affective neuroscience, perceiving systems and autonomous machines.</b>

I also appreciate some forms of [art](http://lushpin.com) and watch science fiction movies, TV or thriller, psychological and shōnen anime. Huge, huge  [Rick and Morty](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/rick_and_morty/) fan.

While I’m not digging into any of that, I read, cook, draw stick figures, hit the gym, swim, listen to pop, alternate or country and write literature. 

Click my name above for my résumé or <a href="https://sudoankit.github.io/resume/">here.</a>
