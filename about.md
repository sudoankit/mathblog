Hi, I'm Ankit Panda.

This blog is about mathematics and simulations of life, love and progress. I sometimes add a bit of philosophy and art in between as mathematics at deep starts to feel like philosophy and look like art.

In case you're wondering what the title means, it's on Cardinality of the Continuum. This states that the cardinality of the real numbers is equal to the cardinality of all subsets of natural numbers.

The picture is of the Calabi-Yau manifold with $n = 5$. 

The Calabi-Yau manifold which is visualized is a 2D slice through a 6-dimensional manifold in a projective space expressed as the 4D manifold $z^5_1 + z^5_2 = 1.$ We can calculate $z_1$ and $z_2$ from: 

$$z_1(\theta, \xi, \kappa_1) = e^{ \frac{2\pi i k_1}{n}} \cosh(\theta + \xi i)^{\frac{2}{n}}    $$

$$i \cdot z_2(\theta, \xi, \kappa_2) = e^{ \frac{2\pi i k_2}{n}} \sinh(\theta + \xi i)^{\frac{2}{n}}    $$

`MATLAB` was used to draw the figure using the following imformation from Hanson's [paper](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~hansona/papers/CP2-94.pdf).
